\usage{
save_plot(
  plot,
  prefix,
  devpars = NULL,
  bg = "white",
  formats = c("png", "pdf"),
  selfcontained = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plot}{The plot object. Can be a ggplot2 object or a plotly/htmlwidget object.
For plotly/htmlwidget objects, only \code{"html"} format is supported. If static formats are
requested, a warning is issued and an HTML file is saved instead.
For ggplot2 objects, \code{"html"} is also supported by converting the plot to a plotly object
via \code{plotly::ggplotly} first.}

\item{prefix}{The prefix of the file
The ending \code{.} is removed from the prefix. So both \verb{/path/to/file} and \verb{/path/to/file.} are valid and will
save the files as \verb{/path/to/file.png}, \verb{/path/to/file.pdf} and \verb{/path/to/file.<format>} etc.}

\item{devpars}{The device parameters}

\item{bg}{The background color}

\item{formats}{The formats to save. Use \code{"html"} to save as an interactive HTML file.}

\item{selfcontained}{Whether to save the HTML file as a self-contained file (only used when saving as HTML).
Default is \code{TRUE}.}
